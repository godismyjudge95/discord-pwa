# Discord PWA

Convert the Discord web version into installable PWA. (inspired from [slack-pwa](https://github.com/gxanshu/slack-pwa))

## Why

I don't want 10 instances of Chrome/Chromium running on my pc.

## How to install

> Note: You will need a Chromium based browser to install this.

1. Install from [webstore](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/discord-pwa)
2. Open [messenger web version](https://discord.com/app), hard reload it (**CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + R**)
3. If it still does not work, clear the cache & cookies of Discord and login again.
4. You will see install PWA button in the URL bar - click, install, and you are ready to go.
