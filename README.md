# Discord PWA

Convert Discord web version into installable PWA. (inspired from [slack-pwa](https://github.com/gxanshu/slack-pwa))

## Why

I don't want 10 instances of Chrome/Chromium running on my pc.

## How to install

> Note you will need chromium based browser to install this

1. Install from [webstore](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/discord-pwa)
7. Open [discord web version](https://discord.com/app), hard reload it (**CTRL + SHIFT + R**)
8. if still not works then clear all the cache & cookies of discord and login again.
9. you will see install PWA button. just install and ready to go
